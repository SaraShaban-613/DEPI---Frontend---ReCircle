Project name : ReCirle(Waste Reduction)


ReCirle – The Waste Reduction App That Connects Generosity with Need
ReCirle is a smart, user-friendly application designed to collect surplus food and clothing from restaurants and households, and redistribute them to people in need—efficiently, safely, and with full transparency.

Core Features
Donor Dashboard Restaurants and individuals can register as donors, list available items (e.g., leftover meals, wearable clothes), and schedule pickups.

Smart Matching System The app uses location-based algorithms to match donations with nearby shelters, charities, or individuals in need.

Pickup & Logistics Coordination ReCirle partners with local delivery services or volunteers to handle transportation. Donors can track pickup status in real time.

Impact Tracker Donors and recipients can see how much waste has been diverted and how many lives have been helped—building a sense of community and purpose.

Safety & Quality Control Built-in guidelines and checklists ensure food safety and clothing hygiene. Donors receive reminders and tips to maintain standards.

Community Wall A social feed where users share stories, thank donors, and highlight successful redistributions—fostering connection and gratitude.

Target Users
Restaurants & Cafés with daily surplus

Households with unused clothes or extra meals

Charities & NGOs serving vulnerable populations

Volunteers who want to help with pickups and outreach

Vision
To create a circular ecosystem where waste becomes a resource, generosity becomes action, and technology becomes a bridge between abundance and need.
